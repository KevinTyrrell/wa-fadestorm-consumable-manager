**Fadestorm Consumable Manager** is a [WeakAura](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2) for *World of Warcraft: Classic* written in Lua. It monitors the stock, application, and duration of a list of consumables & quantities, provided from a user-defined profile in the custom options.

## ‚óÜ Overview ‚óÜ

* Indicates which consumables to bring according to your selected profile.
* Shows if you have enough supply, or if the item is stored elsewhere (bank, mail, etc)
* Marks whether a consumable's buff is missing, or is running low.
* Attaches to the bottom of the character frame; only displaying when open.
* Let's you customize when items show or hide through user-defined 'rules'.

---

## ‚ñ≤ Usage ‚ñ≤

1. Profiles
    - Create a new profile with a memorable name, e.g. `Myhunter: AQ40`
    - *Note: The loaded profile is always the first profile in the list. To re-arrange profiles, click the ‚ñ≥/‚ñΩ Arrows.*
    - For each profile, provide names of items and the desired quantity to be brought for each item. *e.g. `Major Mana Potion`, `10`*
2. Display
    - For each of the profile's consumables (if not hidden by a rule) will have one of each symbol:
        * **Quantity**
            - | ![OK](https://img.shields.io/badge/OK-green) | Item supply in bags meets your preferences.
            - | ![+?](https://img.shields.io/badge/+%3F-yellow) | Item supply is met, but items are outside your bags. By default, your bank. *Note: If [TSM](https://tradeskillmaster.com/) is installed, 'outside your bags' includes mailbox, other characters, etc. For Bind-on-Pickup items, only your bags & bank are checked.*
            - | ![NO](https://img.shields.io/badge/NO-red) | Item supply is not met.
        * **Application**
            - | ![--](https://img.shields.io/badge/----%20-white) | Item's buff is applied with a healthy duration, *or has no associated buff*.
            - | ![<<](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3C%3C-tan) | Item's buff is applied, but is considered to be low duration *(adjustable by the `low duration` slider)*.
            - | ![>>](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3E%3E-orange) | Item's buff is not applied.
3. Rules
    * **Rules allow fine control over when items are to-be hidden**, as [large volumes of tracked items can yield an unwieldy display](res/ruleless-screenshot.png) otherwise.
    * Rules consist of a list of `conditions`, each of which is evaluated against an item. If all conditions evaluate to `true` for a given item, *that item will be hidden from the display at that moment*.
    * *Note: A rule can be enabled/disabled at any time using the Rule Enabled checkbox.*
    * Conditions
        - *A condition can be negated/inverted using the `Negate Condition` checkbox.*
        - List of available conditions:
            * | `In Dungeon/Raid` | `true` if the player is currently in a dungeon/raid.
            * | `In Rested Area` | `true` if the player is in a major city or inn.
            * | `Item Yields Buff` | `true` if the item can apply a long-standing aura. Items whose buffs cannot be continuously refreshed are not included (e.g. `Mighty Rage Potion`).
            * | `Item In Inventory` | `true` if the player's bags contain at least one of the item.
            * | `Item Supply Healthy` | `true` if the player's bags meet the preferred supply of the item.
            * | `Player Max Level` | `true` if the player's character is max level.
            * | `Item Is Soulbound` | `true` if the item cannot be traded.

* Then, after 'cloning' the repository you will be presented with all the files modified with your project details and information. It is essential to **manually review every file** to check if it fits your requirements and performs any necessary changes to customize the project as you want.

* If you are using **Windows** and you don't know how to execute the `SETUP_TEMPLATE.sh` script:
  1. Install **[git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)**.

## ‚úé Notes ‚úé

These are recommended bots that are prepared and configured for this template. If you install them, your coding experience will probably be much better.
We sincerely recommend at least installing the [issue label bot](https://github.com/marketplace/issue-label-bot) as this bot is the one that adds all the labels used in the issue templates.

1. The `issue_label_bot.yaml` file depends on the **[issue label bot](https://github.com/marketplace/issue-label-bot)** (‚úì highly recommended).
2. The `settings.yml` file depends on the **[settings label bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/)** (optional).
3. The `config.yml` file depends on the bot **[welcome bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/welcome/)** and **[to-do bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/todo/)** (optional).
